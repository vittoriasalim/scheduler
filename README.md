# scheduler

Our team creates a tool to help students find an optimal and preferred scheduler for them. <br />
Sample Input: <br />
- COMP2017;1;1100;1200
- COMP2017;2;1100;1200
- INFO2222;1;1000;1200 <br />
There are 2 units which are called "COMP2017" and "INFO2222". Unit COMP2017 have 2 options which are for Monday and Tuesday from 11am to 12pm.
With our tool, the student will get different possible schedules for COMP2017 and INFO2222. <br />

Our team also includes users' preferences such as:
- The number of days they want their units to be in.
- The minimum free (or available) time (in minutes) between 2 units (or events).
- Morning or Afternoon schedule.

*The frontend and the backend are separated. The sample data can be found in the directory 'backend'.* <br />
*Use Android Studio to run the frontend.*
